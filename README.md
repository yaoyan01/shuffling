top down shuffling and riffle shuffling simulation

# top down shuffling 
takes the first card of the deck and then ramdonly selects a spot in the deck to place it in
repeating it until the last card of the deck is shuffled results in a random deck 

# riffle shuffing 
takes a deck and then simulates a riffle shuffle on it 
the probability of making a k-sized left hand deck is (len(deck) choose k) / 2 ^ n
the probability of the next card that will land on the shuffled deck is a choice between 
the card coming from the left hand or right hand, which is decided through a random choice 
between probabilities 

# result 
shuffles two decks of your choice! :)
